Tetris
======

This is my very first programming project. 
It contains a lot of bugs and its architecture is doubtful. 
I do realize that rewriting it complietly is probably a good idea, 
since it is not that big. However, I would like to stick to what I 
have already done and try to fix it. 

If you happen to see this code and you have useful suggestions on how 
I can improve it and general comments on how I should have done it so 
it is more simple and efficient, please let me know. 

At the end, people who write shitty code sometimes just don't have anyone to 
turn to for a review and advice.
